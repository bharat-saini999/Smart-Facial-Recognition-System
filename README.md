# Smart-Facial-Recognition-System
This is one of my projects which i submitted in my college after summer break.

This project is a GUI-based attendance system built using Python, OpenCV, and Tkinter. It uses face recognition to automatically mark attendance of students/employees in real time using a webcam.

-------------Technologies Used :------

1.Python

2.OpenCV

3.Tkinter

4.Pandas & NumPy

5.PIL (Pillow) for image handling

6.CSV for data storage

--------------How It Works:-----------

1.Register New User
  Enter ID & Name → Capture Face Images → Save Profile (password-protected)

2.Train Model
  Trains on captured images and saves the facial features for recognition.

3.Mark Attendance
  Launch face recognition → Identify user → Log attendance in CSV file.
